\begin{problem}{V.1.1}
Let $R$ be an Notherian ring, and let $I$ be an ideal of $R$. Prove that $R/I$ is a Notherian ring.
\end{problem}
\begin{pf}
The projection $\varphi: R \to R/I$ is clearly an surjective homomorphism, and by III.4.2 $R/I$ is Notherian.
\end{pf}

\begin{problem}{V.1.2}
Prove that if $R[x]$ is Notherian, then so is $R$.
\end{problem}
\begin{pf}
\[
\pi: R[x] \to R[x]/(x) \cong R
\]
is surjective, and by V.1.1 $R$ is Notherian.
\end{pf}

\begin{problem}{V.1.4}
Let $R$ be the ring of real-valued continuous functions on the interval $[0,1]$. Prove that $R$ is not Noetherian.
\end{problem}
\begin{pf}
Let $\{f_n\}_{n = 1}^\infty$ be continuous functions so that $f_n$ has support on $[0,1-2^{-n}]$ (i.e. $f_n = 0$ on $(1-2^{-n},1]$). Then  
\[
(f_1) \subseteq (f_2) \subseteq \cdots (f_n) \subseteq \cdots	
\] 
is an increasing sequence of ideals that does not terminate. By Proposition V.1.1, $R$ is not Noetherian.
\end{pf}

\begin{problem}{V.1.6}
Let $I$ be an ideal of $R[x]$, and let $A \subseteq R$ be the set defined in the proof of Theorem 1.2. Prove that $A$ is an ideal of $R$.
\end{problem}
\begin{pf}
$A$ is a subgroup of $(R,+)$: For $a, b \in A$, there is some $f, g \in I$ so that the leading coefficient of $f$ (resp. $g$) is $a$ (resp. $b$). Assume that $\deg(f) \geq \deg(g)$. Then $f - x^{\deg(f)-\deg(g)}g$ is an element of $I$, and it has leading coefficient $a-b$, which is in $A$, so $A$ is a subgroup.

$A$ satisfies absorption property: If $a \in R$, then there is some $f \in I$ such that $a$ is the leading coefficient of $f$. Then $rf \in I$ has leading coefficient $ra$, which is in $A$, so $ra \in A$ for all $r \in R$. Therefore $A$ is an ideal.   
\end{pf}

\begin{problem}{V.1.8}
Prove that every ideal in a Noetherian ring $R$ contains a finite product of prime ideals. 
\end{problem}
\begin{pf}
Suppose there are some ideals that does not contain a finite product of prime ideals. Let us collect these ideals and form a family $\mathscr{F}$, which clearly is nonempty. Since $R$ is Noetherian, there is an maximal ideal with respect to inclusion in $\mathscr{F}$, which we call it $M$. Since $M$ is not prime, there exists $a,b \notin M$ such that $ab \in M$. Now consider two ideals that are larger than $M$ (so they contain a finite product of prime ideals):
\[
M + (a), M + (b)
\]
Note that both of them are \emph{proper}: If $M+aR = R$, then $bM + baR = bR$, and since $bM + baR \subseteq M$ we would have $bR \subseteq M$, i.e. $b \in M$, a contradiction. Then since
\[
(M+(a))(M+(b)) \subseteq M
\]
and since the product on the left contains a finite product of prime ideals, $M$ contains a finite product of prime ideals, a contradiction. Therefore $\mathscr{F} = \varnothing$, and the assertion is proved.
\end{pf}

\begin{problem}{V.1.12}
Let $R$ be an integral domain. Prove that a nonzero $a$ is irreducible if and only if $(a)$ is maximal among proper principle ideal of $R$.
\end{problem}
\begin{pf}

\noindent $(\Rightarrow)$ If $a$ is irreducible but there is some $b \in R$ such that $(a) \subseteq (b)$, then we can write $a = bc$ for some $c \in R$. Then either $b$ is a unit, or $c$ is a unit. The former would lead to that $(b) = R$, and the latter says that there is also $c^{-1}$ such that $ac^{-1} = b$, so $(a)\supseteq (b)$, so $(a) = (b)$. Either way, $(a)$ is the maximal amongst all principle ideals. \\
$(\Leftarrow)$ If $a = bc$, then $(a) \subseteq (b)$. Since $(a)$ is maximal amongst all principle ideal, we must have $(b) = R$ or $(b) = (a)$. In the former we have that $b$ is a unit, and the latter implies that $c$ is a unit. In both cases at least one of $b$ and $c$ is a unit, so $a$ is irreducible. 
\end{pf}

\begin{problem}{V.1.17}
    Consider the subring of $\C$:
    \[
    \Z[\sqrt{-5}] := \{a+bi\sqrt{5} \; | \; a,b\in Z\}	
    \]
    Prove that $\Z[\sqrt{-5}]$ is not a UFD.
    \end{problem}
    \begin{pf}
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0pt}
    \item By the same argument as in the 4th point of III.4.10, $\Z[\sqrt{-5}] \cong \Z[t]/(t^2-5)$.
    \item $\Z[t]$ is Noetherian ($\Z$ is Noetherian and Hilbert Basis), so $\Z[t]/(t^2-5) \cong \Z[\sqrt{-5}]$ is Noetherian by V.1.1. Since $(t^2 + 5)$ is maximal (hence prime), the quotient $\Z[t]/(t^2-5) \cong \Z[\sqrt{-5}]$ is a domain.
    \item The norm $N(a+bi\sqrt{5}) = a^2 + 5b^2$ satisfies the multiplicative property by the same argument as in the 2nd point of III.4.10.
    \item If an element $u$ is a unit, then we must have $N(u)N(u^{-1}) = N(1) = 1$, and this forces $N(u) = 1$ as the definition of norm guarantees $N(a) \geq 1$ for all nonzero $a$, so $u = \pm 1 $.
    \item If $a, b \in \Z[\sqrt{-5}]$ satisfies $ab = 2$ (resp. $3, 1+i\sqrt{5}, 1-i\sqrt{5}$), then we have $N(a)N(b) = 4$ (resp. $9,6,6$). If $N(a) \geq N(b)$, then we must have $N(a) = 4$ (resp. $9,6,6$) since $\Z[\sqrt{-5}]$ does not contain elements such that $N(a) = 2 \text{ or } 3$.
    \item $6 = 2 \cdot 3 = (1 + i \sqrt{5}) (1 - i \sqrt{5})$.
    \item Since the factorization of $6$ is not unique, $\Z[\sqrt{-5}]$ is not a UFD.
\end{itemize}
\end{pf}

\begin{problem}{V.2.1}
Prove Lemma 2.1: 

\textit{
Let R be a UFD, and let a,b,c be nonzero elements of R. Then
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0pt}
    \item $(a)\subseteq(b) \Longleftrightarrow$ the multiset of irreducible factors of b is contained in the multiset of irreducible factors of a;
    \item a and b are associates $\Longleftrightarrow$ the two multiset coincide;
    \item the irreducible factors of a product bc are the collection of all irreducible factors of b and c. 
\end{itemize}
}
\end{problem}
\begin{pf}
\begin{itemize}	
    \setlength\itemsep{0pt}
    \item The inclusion on the right implies $a = bp$ for some $p$, so clearly the multiset of $a$ contains the multiset of $b$. Conversely, we can let $p$ be the product of difference of the multiset of $a$ and $b$. Then $a = pb$ (up to associates), so $(a)\subseteq(b)$.
    \item A unit $u$ is \emph{not} a product of irreducibles by definition. Therefore if $(a) = (b)$, then $a = bn$ for some unit $n$, and since $n$ does not contain irreducibles, the multiset must coincide. The converse is just the reverse of this argument.
    \item Direct by expanding $b$ and $c$.
\end{itemize}
\end{pf}

\begin{problem}{V.2.5}
Let $R$ be the subring of $\Z[t]$ consisting of polynomials with no term of degree 1.
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0pt}
    \item Prove that $R$ is indeed a subring of $\Z[t]$, and conclude that $R$ is an integral domain.
    \item List all common divisor of $t^5$ and $t^6$ in $R$.
    \item Prove that $t^5$ and $t^6$ have no gcd in $R$.
\end{itemize}
\end{problem}
\begin{pf}
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0pt}
    \item Clearly $R$ is a subring since the difference of two polynomials in $R$ has no term of degree 1. It is a domain since you still can't have two nonzero polynomials that has product $0$.
    \item If $(t^5, t^6) \subseteq (p)$, then $p$ can be $1, t, t^2, t^3, t^4$ or $t^5$.
    \item gcd did not exist since for any $k \in \{0,1,2,3,4,5\}$, $t^{k-1} \mid t^5, t^{k-1} \mid t^6$, but $t^{k-1} \nmid t^k$ since $R$ does not contain $t$.
\end{itemize}
\end{pf}

\begin{problem}{V.2.7}
Let $R$ be a Notherian domain, and assume that for all nonzero $a,b$ in $R$, the greatest common divisors of $a$ and $b$ are linear combinations of $a$ and $b$. Prove that $R$ is a PID.
\end{problem}
\begin{pf}
We have the clear inclusion
\[
(a,b) \subseteq (\gcd(a,b))	
\]
and since $\gcd(a,b)$ is the linear combination of $a$ and $b$, we also have $(a,b) \ni \gcd(a,b)$, hence $(a,b) = (\gcd(a,b))$. It follows that by a simple induction, all finitely generated ideals $(p_1,\dotsc,p_n)$ is equal to the principle ideal
\[
(\gcd(p_1, \gcd(p_2, \gcd(\cdots,\gcd(p_{n-1}, p_n)))))
\]
Since $R$ is Notherian, all ideals are finitely generated, so $R$ is a PID.
\end{pf}

\begin{problem}{V.2.9}
The \emph{height} of a prime ideal $P$ in a ring $R$ is (if finite) the maximum length $h$ of a chain of prime ideals $P_0 \subsetneq P_1 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq P_h = P$ in $R$. Prove that if $R$ is a UFD, then every prime ideal of height $1$ in $R$ is principle.
\end{problem}
\begin{pf}
Let $P$ be a prime ideal that is of height 1. Since $P$ is prime and $R$ is a UFD, there is some irreducible element $p \in P$. Since irreducible implies prime, the ideal $(p)$ is prime. Then we would have a chain of prime ideals 
\[
0 \subseteq (p) \subseteq P
\]
but since this chain must be of height $1$, we must have $(p) = P$, showing that $P$ is principle.
\end{pf}

\begin{problem}{V.2.10}
Assuming that every nonzero, nonunit element in a Notherian domain is contained in a prime ideal of height 1. Prove a converse of Exercise 2.9, and conclude that a Notherian domain $R$ is a UFD if and only if every prime ideal of height 1 in $R$ is principle.
\end{problem}
\begin{pf}
Let $R$ be a Notherian domain, and assuming that every prime ideal of height 1 is principle in $R$. By Theorem V.2.5, we need to show that
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
	\item the a.c.c for principle ideals holds in $R$: this is clear since $R$ is Notherian;
	\item every irreducible element of $R$ is prime: let $x$ be irreducible, and by assumption, it is contained in a prime ideal of height 1 (hence principle), say $x \in P = (p)$. This says that $x = pa$ for some $a \in R$, and since $x$ is irreducible, either $p$ is a unit (then $P=R$, which can't be), or $a$ is a unit. Then we can write $p = xa^{-1}$, and since $p$ is prime, $x$ must be prime (a unit can't be prime).
\end{itemize}
Hence $R$ is a UFD.
\end{pf}

\begin{problem}{V.2.12}
Prove that if $R[x]$ is a PID, then $R$ is a field.
\end{problem}
\begin{pf}
Recall that $(x-c)$ is a prime ideal of $R[x]$ (cf. Example III.4.7), and PID implies prime $\Rightarrow$ maximal (Proposition III.4.13). Therefore the quotient
\[
\frac{R[x]}{(x-c)} \cong R
\]
is a field, by definition.
\end{pf}

\begin{problem}{V.2.15}
Prove that if $R$ is a Euclidean domain, then $R$ admits a Euclidean valuation $\bar{v}$ such that $\bar{v}(ab) \geq \bar{v}(b)$ for all nonzero $a,b \in R$.
\end{problem}
\begin{pf}
Let $v$ be a valuation on $R$. Define 
\[
\bar{v}(a) = \min\{v(ab): b \in R\}
\]
then it follows that $v(ab) \geq \bar{v}(b)$ for all $a \in R$, so $\bar{v}(ab) \geq \bar{v}(b)$. It suffices to check that it is a valuation with respect to $R$. Let $a,b \in R$ be such that $b \nmid a$, and choose $q,r$ such that $a = bq+r$. We claim that we must have $\bar{v}(r) < \bar{v}(b)$. Suppose not, that is, $\bar{v}(r) \geq \bar{v}(b)$. Let the minimum of $\bar{v}(b)$ be achieved at, say, $\bar{v}(b) = v(bc)$. Since we have $ac = bqc+rc$,
\[
\bar{v}(b) = v(bc) > v(rc) \geq \bar{v}(r) 
\]
a contradiction to our assumption. Therefore $\bar{v}(r) < \bar{v}(b)$, and $\bar{v}$ is indeed a Euclidean valuation.
\end{pf}

\begin{problem}{V.2.16}
Let $R$ be a Euclidean domain with Euclidean valuation $v$; assume that $v(ab) \geq v(b)$ for all nonzero $a,b \in R$ (cf. Exercise 2.15). Prove that associate elements have the same valuation and that units have minimum valuation.
\end{problem}
\begin{pf}
Let $a = ub$ with $u$ being a unit. Then $v(a) = v(ub) \geq v(b)$. We also have $v(b) = v(u^{-1}a) \geq v(a)$, so $v(a) = v(b)$. If $u$ is a unit, then $v(au) \geq v(u)$ for all nonzero $a$, and since $au$ exhaust all elements of $R$ ($Ru = R$), $u$ must be minimal.
\end{pf}

\begin{problem}{V.2.17}
Let $R$ be a Euclidean domain that is not a field. Prove that there exists a nonzero, nonunit element $c \in R$ such that $\forall a \in R, \exists q,r \in R$ with $a = qc+r$ and either $r = 0$ or $r$ is a unit.
\end{problem}
\begin{pf}
Let $c$ be irreducible in $R$ that is \emph{minimal} in the norm sense. Since $R$ is a ED, there is a valuation $v$ such that $v(ab) \geq v(b)$ for all nonzero $a,b \in R$ (V.2.15). Now for every $a \in R$, there exists $q,r \in R$ such that $a = qc+r$ and $v(r) < v(c)$. But then $r$ must be a unit, as all nonunit element admits a factorization $p_1\cdots p_np_0$ (up to associates), and we have
\[
v(p_1\cdots p_np_0) \geq v(p_2\cdots p_np_0) \geq \cdots v(p_np_0) \geq v(p_0) \geq v(c)
\]
Therefore $r$ must be a unit (V.2.16) or $0$.
\end{pf}

\begin{problem}{V.2.18}
Prove that the subring of $\Q(\sqrt{-19})$, $\Z[(1+\sqrt{-19})/2]$, is not a Euclidean domain (cf. V.1.17).
\end{problem}
\begin{pf}
Denote $\delta = (1+i\sqrt{19})/2$.
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
	\item We have $N(a+b\delta) = (a+b/2)^2 + 19b^2/4$. There is no $z = a+b\delta$ such that $N(z) = 2$ or $3$ as $19b^2/4 > 4$ if $b \geq 1$, and there are no integers $a$ such that $a^2 = 2$ or $3$. On the other hand, $N(0) = 1, N(1) = 1, N(2) = 4, N(\delta) = 5$. Also $N(a+b\delta) \geq N(\delta) = 5$ if $b \neq 0$.
	\item Units in this ring are $\pm 1$ by the same argument as in 4th point of V.1.17.
	\item If $c$ satisfies the condition in V.2.17, then the remainder of the expression $a = qc + r$ can only be $\pm 1$ or $0$; in particular, c divides $2$ and $3$ since $2 = qc + r$ leads to $2 = qc$, $3 = qc$ and $1 = qc$(can't be as $c$ is not a unit). By multiplicative property of norm (cf. 5th point of V.1.17.) we can conclude that $c = \pm 2$ or $\pm 3$.
	\item However, there is no $q$ such that $\delta = qc + r$ with $c = \pm 2, \pm 3$ and $r = 0, \pm 1$: This would give combinations
	\[
	\delta = \pm 2q(\pm 3q), \; -1+\delta = \pm 2q(\pm 3q), \; 1+\delta = \pm 2q(\pm 3q)
	\]
	Note that $N(\delta) = 5, N(-1+\delta) = 5, N(1+\delta) = 7$, and all of them are not divisible by 2 or 3, so such $q$ does not exist.
\end{itemize}
Since we can't find $q,r$ such that $\delta = qc+r$, the 'division with remainder' does not work in $R$, so we conclude that $R$ is not a Euclidean domain.
\end{pf}
